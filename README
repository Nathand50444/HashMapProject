# Basic Hash Map

This basic implementation of a hash map data structure in Ruby stores key-value pairs and allows for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of elements. I believe this program demonstrates my skills in fundamental programming and showcases my ability to design and implement complex data structures.

## Example Methods

* `set(key, value)`: Inserts a new key-value pair into the hash map.
* `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
* `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the hash map.
* `resize`: Dynamically resizes the hash map to maintain optimal performance.

## main.rb

Demonstrates how the hash map can be used and manipulated for most methods.
